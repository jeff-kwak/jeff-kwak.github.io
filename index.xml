      <description>2020-08-05 1209H EDT Today is the day the game will be finished. Putting a little &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; into the repo (a to-do list). Decided to rename the game to &amp;ldquo;Relax and Rewind&amp;rdquo;. Want to give it a sort of Zen Garden aesthetic. Decided against scoring and timers. Just put the puzzle back together, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t just rewind.
2020-08-05 1713H EDT Figured out a nuance with the Input System. The orbit camera is best served by listening to something called Delta [Pointer] bindings.</description>

      <description>2020-08-04 1210H EDT Day 4 and really the first day of &amp;ldquo;The Pivot&amp;rdquo;. Previously, I had thought of a pretty interesting game &amp;ldquo;Rewind Maestro&amp;rdquo;. This is a do-able game in the time frame, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m just not excited enough by the idea to work on it. I can&amp;rsquo;t yet come up with the style in my mind that would make it fun and compelling. The overall idea is pretty neat though.</description>

      <description>2020-08-03 0759H EDT Today working on a lot of the generation algorithms. Primary dungeon and path generation will be complete today. Need to get as far as the REWIND mechanic.
2020-08-03 0847H EDT Have initial room spawning complete. Need to get some work done at the office (remotely of course).
2020-08-03 2016H EDT Actually not spawning Nilrem in the GameController. Nilrem and the first room always spawn at the same location.</description>

      <description>2020-08-02 1005H EDT I think I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to spend the time to put together a skeleton and some stories. I&amp;rsquo;d like to get a rough idea of the size of this project. I have a suspicion that it&amp;rsquo;s too big.
2020-08-02 1135H EDT I built out a rough backlog, which made me make a couple of decisions.
 I decided to use the URP template in Unity because it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest to use and I wanted to add a little juice with Shader and the Effects Graph.</description>

      <description>2020-08-01 0800H EDT Woke up and the jam has been going on for 2 hours already. The theme is &amp;ldquo;REWIND&amp;rdquo;. Time for coffee and to noodle on some ideas for the game.
2020-08-01 1000H EDT I have a couple of ideas around the theme. In no particular order:
 A maze game where you can only go backwards by a &amp;ldquo;REWIND&amp;rdquo;. You only get so many rewinds per level. A time traveler game.</description>

      <title>Creating a Unity3D Package for Stateless</title>
      <link>https://jeffkwak.com/posts/unity3d-package-for-stateless/</link>

      <description>One pattern that I depend on all the time is the State Machine pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to decouple inherit state from the game objects in your system. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple pattern that&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to implement yourself, but there already happens to be a complete and robust library in the C# eco-system: Stateless. Also, unfortunate, you cannot use .NET&amp;rsquo;s package manager in Unity (that&amp;rsquo;d be a little weird but awesome).</description>

      <title>Using Unity&#39;s Input System with Cinemachine</title>
      <link>https://jeffkwak.com/posts/unity-input-system-cinemachine/</link>

      <description>In Unity3D (v2019.4.x), when you try to use the Cinemachine and the new Input System you will receive a slightly confusing error message:
 InvalidOperationException: You are trying to read Input using the UnityEngine.Input class, but you have switched active Input handling to Input System package in Player Settings.
 There&amp;rsquo;s a simple explanation for this. The old Input mechanism is still around, and still supported, and existing packages still have to support it.</description>

      <description>I am a Dark Matter Developer This is probably my fourth attempt at blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve always realized that writing is important, but eventually I get busy with life or a project at work and let missing a few days turn into missing a few years. I swear I&amp;rsquo;m still out there building software, I&amp;rsquo;m just hard to see.
This is probably for an audience of one I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep this blog up and running for a change.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Jeff Kwak. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer for a long time. Like most people of my generation, I first got into programming by typing in code from magazines to play games. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve professionally developed for just about everything from 8-bit assembly language for micro-controllers all the way to modern distributed applications using microservices. I still love making the machine(s) do things; it still feels like a creative outlet.</description>
