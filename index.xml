      <description>I am a Dark Matter Developer This is probably my fourth attempt at blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve always realized that writing is important, but eventually I get busy with life or a project at work and let missing a few days turn into missing a few years. I swear I&amp;rsquo;m still out there building software, I&amp;rsquo;m just hard to see.
This is probably for an audience of one I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep this blog up and running for a change.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Jeff Kwak. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer for a long time. Like most people of my generation, I first got into programming by typing in code from magazines to play games. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve professionally developed for just about everything from 8-bit assembly language for micro-controllers all the way to modern distributed applications using microservices. I still love making the machine(s) do things; it still feels like a creative outlet.</description>
