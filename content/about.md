I'm Jeff Kwak. I've been a software engineer for a long time. Like most people of my generation, I first got into programming by typing in code from magazines to play games. Since then I've professionally developed for just about everything from 8-bit assembly language for micro-controllers all the way to modern distributed applications using microservices. I still love making the machine(s) do things; it still feels like a creative outlet.

I'm a proud dad. I still dabble in games as a hobby.

You can contact me through jeff.kwak at the GMail.
