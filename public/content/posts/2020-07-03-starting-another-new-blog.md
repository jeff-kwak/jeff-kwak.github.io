# I am a Dark Matter Developer
This is probably my fourth attempt at blogging. I've always realized that writing is important, but eventually I get busy with life or a project at work and let missing a few days turn into missing a few years. I swear I'm still out there building software, I'm just hard to see.

# This is probably for an audience of one
I'd like to keep this blog up and running for a change. One thing I've realized from efforts in the past is that I've tried to make every post worthy of a scientific journal. Maybe I should remember my real audience is me. Technology wise I'll just keep taking notes, and try to explain things to myself. I'm not going to sweat it; if the writing is so so.
