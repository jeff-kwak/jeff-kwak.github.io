      <title>Creating and Using Unity Packages on GitHub</title>

      <description>Unity does a good job of blending in with the .NET ecosystem, but it stands alone as something a little different. I had initially packaged Stateless, but in a couple of projects I started to have issues compiling. The StateMachine pattern at it&amp;rsquo;s most basic level is pretty simple so I just made a version specific to Unity (the first release is definitely an MVP implementation): gr8tgames/statemachine.
Targetting the new Unity Package Manager format, I came across this excellent tutorial from InfallibleCode: A Better Way To Share Your Code!</description>

      <description>One pattern that I depend on all the time is the State Machine pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to decouple inherit state from the game objects in your system. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple pattern that&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to implement yourself, but there already happens to be a complete and robust library in the C# eco-system: Stateless. Also, unfortunate, you cannot use .NET&amp;rsquo;s package manager in Unity (that&amp;rsquo;d be a little weird but awesome).</description>

      <title>Using Unity&#39;s Input System with Cinemachine</title>

      <description>In Unity3D (v2019.4.x), when you try to use the Cinemachine and the new Input System you will receive a slightly confusing error message:
 InvalidOperationException: You are trying to read Input using the UnityEngine.Input class, but you have switched active Input handling to Input System package in Player Settings.
 There&amp;rsquo;s a simple explanation for this. The old Input mechanism is still around, and still supported, and existing packages still have to support it.</description>
