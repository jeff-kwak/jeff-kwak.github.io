      <description>2020-08-05 1209H EDT Today is the day the game will be finished. Putting a little &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; into the repo (a to-do list). Decided to rename the game to &amp;ldquo;Relax and Rewind&amp;rdquo;. Want to give it a sort of Zen Garden aesthetic. Decided against scoring and timers. Just put the puzzle back together, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t just rewind.
2020-08-05 1713H EDT Figured out a nuance with the Input System. The orbit camera is best served by listening to something called Delta [Pointer] bindings.</description>

      <description>2020-08-04 1210H EDT Day 4 and really the first day of &amp;ldquo;The Pivot&amp;rdquo;. Previously, I had thought of a pretty interesting game &amp;ldquo;Rewind Maestro&amp;rdquo;. This is a do-able game in the time frame, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m just not excited enough by the idea to work on it. I can&amp;rsquo;t yet come up with the style in my mind that would make it fun and compelling. The overall idea is pretty neat though.</description>

      <description>2020-08-03 0759H EDT Today working on a lot of the generation algorithms. Primary dungeon and path generation will be complete today. Need to get as far as the REWIND mechanic.
2020-08-03 0847H EDT Have initial room spawning complete. Need to get some work done at the office (remotely of course).
2020-08-03 2016H EDT Actually not spawning Nilrem in the GameController. Nilrem and the first room always spawn at the same location.</description>

      <description>2020-08-02 1005H EDT I think I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to spend the time to put together a skeleton and some stories. I&amp;rsquo;d like to get a rough idea of the size of this project. I have a suspicion that it&amp;rsquo;s too big.
2020-08-02 1135H EDT I built out a rough backlog, which made me make a couple of decisions.
 I decided to use the URP template in Unity because it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest to use and I wanted to add a little juice with Shader and the Effects Graph.</description>

      <description>2020-08-01 0800H EDT Woke up and the jam has been going on for 2 hours already. The theme is &amp;ldquo;REWIND&amp;rdquo;. Time for coffee and to noodle on some ideas for the game.
2020-08-01 1000H EDT I have a couple of ideas around the theme. In no particular order:
 A maze game where you can only go backwards by a &amp;ldquo;REWIND&amp;rdquo;. You only get so many rewinds per level. A time traveler game.</description>
